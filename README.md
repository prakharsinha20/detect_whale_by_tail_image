# detect_whale_by_tail_image
In this project we try to build an algorithm to identify individual whales in images. Just by analyzing the surveillance image of the tail of a whale, we need to find wheter the whale has been recorded before(i.e. it is present in the database and has an 'Id') or its a completely new whale which hasnt been recorded before. The project uses TensorFlow for image classification.
Please note that this project is still in development.
